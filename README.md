# Open Ulm App 

This is an application for the Nokia Feature Phone Series. It was developed 
within a week long hackathon at Nokia here in Ulm.

We wanted to take use of some OpenData related sources and build an app that
lets you comfortably access information on interesting city stuff.  

 * local postboxes are displayed using data from the OpenStreetMaps project 
 * local restaurants and bars that have opened right now are displayed
 * the next bus and tram stations are displayed on a map
